# Web_Scraping and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Flask

## Summary

In this challenge, I was tasked with 3 deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

Deliverable 1 included an addition to the existing code I worked on in the module and thought it was the most challenging and time-consuming of the 3 exercises. Deliverable 2 then had me update the Flask web app with a new function to deliver the results of deliverable 1 as a new dictionary item. Deliverable 3 had me update the app using bootstrap and CSS to enhance the layout and make it mobile-responsive. Overall, a challenging module.
